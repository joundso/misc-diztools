#' @title Normal `paste` function with additional `collapse_last` argument.
#' @description The base `paste` function but with the add on to also supply a
#'   `collapse_last` value to change the `collapse` argument at the last
#'   position. To get from "cat", "mouse", "dog" to a string
#'   "cat, mouse and dog", one simply needs to call
#'   `paste(c("cat","mouse","dog"), collapse = ", ", collapse_last = " and ")`
#'
#' @param collapse_last (string, optional) The string to use for the last
#'   instance while collapsing. All other elements will be pasted using
#'   the normal `collapse` argument.
#' @inheritParams base::paste
#' @return String. See`?paste` for details.
#' @examples{
#'   paste2(c("cat", "mouse", "dog"),
#'          collapse = ", ",
#'          collapse_last = " and ")
#'   #> [1] "cat, mouse and dog"
#' }
